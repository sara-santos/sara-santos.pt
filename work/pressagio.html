                        <p>In order to develop a publication around the theme “Manifesto”, Presságio appeared. Presságio is the name given to this book for having as motto a poem with the same name by Fernando Pessoa. This book is about non-verbal poetry. The same poem, two approaches. The traditional one, and the one I gave through images. The idea of creating a book based on images came from the concept of unconscious manifestation, as a way for each of us to manifest ourselves. This concept, in turn, can translate into non-verbal communication. My main goal is, therefore, to manifest myself through non-verbal communication and awaken unconscious manifestations in the reader. Presságio tells the story of a poem that is deeply melancholic, yet hopeful. Written by Fernando Pessoa, narrated by me.</p>

                        <p>
                        To complement this book and serve as a symbol, I created a flag with the sequential solution of the images used throughout the book. From the book cover to the flag itself, the goal was always to make an omen – presságio – for the book itself.</p>
